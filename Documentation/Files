## Resume Points

ADMIN DASHBOARD

1. I built an analytics dashboard that tracks the conversion funnel. By analyzing the view-to-purchase ratio, we can identify drop-off points and 
optimize the recommendation algorithm to improve conversions."
2. The trending algorithm uses exponential time decay with a configurable lambda. Products with recent activity get higher scores than those with equal 
historical engagement but older timestamps. This ensures the homepage always shows fresh, currently-popular items rather than legacy bestsellers.
3. I built an admin dashboard for our recommendation system because production ML isn't just about accuracy metrics - you need operational visibility. 
The cache management interface was critical because our ML pipelines run periodically, and without manual cache invalidation, users would see stale 
recommendations for up to an hour."
